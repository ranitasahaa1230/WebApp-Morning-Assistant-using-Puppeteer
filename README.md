# WebApp Morning Assistant

We all like to know some basic things about our day each day and move to different websites and apps, this project brings to you all that in your whatsapp chat. It can be simply used each morning to get all the basic information about the day. 
I have included some things like:- 
  1. A quote which will keep you motivated for the day.
  2. Get your horoscope for the day based on your astrological signs.
  3. Weather Forecast for the day.
  4. What is the day special for ?
  5. News Headlines.

All of the above are scraped using Puppetter and are real time data. Data Scraping is performed at backend and is returned to you via messages on your phone.

Requirements of the project : puppetter needs to be installed in the working folder. 
   To install use npm (npm install puppeteer)
